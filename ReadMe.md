## About
Endless Tower is a 2D idle RPG game that features various RPG elements such as equipment, powerups and the progression of a player's stats. 

This was a solo project during the summer of 2022 using Unity and it is my first exposure to game development.

## Code
- The main bulk of the source code for the scripts can be found in `/Scripts`.

## Future Goals
1. Refactor code to increase readability and efficiency upon creating new additions in the future.
2. Add varying enemy units that give power ups during the game itself.
3. Rebalance stats calculation into a non-linear formula to create a better difficulty curve for the player.

## Known Bugs
1. Existing Special Buffs do not despawn upon reaching max buffs.
