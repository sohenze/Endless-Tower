## About
Endless Tower is a 2D idle RPG game that features various RPG elements such as equipment, powerups and the progression of a player's stats. 

This was a summer project attempted solely by me during the summer of 2022 using Unity. As this was a passion project and my first exposure at game development as
well as C# and Unity, code quality was not highly prioritised during initial development but is being worked on currently.

## Future Goals
1. Refactor code to increase readability and efficiency upon creating new additions in the future.
2. Add varying enemy units that give power ups during the game itself.
3. Rebalance stats calculation into a non-linear formula to create a better difficulty curve for the player.

## Known Bugs
1. Existing Special Buffs do not despawn upon reaching max buffs.
